first train of smallVGGNet and keras-multi-lable :

start traine date : 1shanbe , 31/4/97 ...until epoch 48
end train date : not clear but finished on 3shanbe 2/5/97


dataset : the same as thesis dataset just paper-cigarette was diffetent. that will be replace by new version of papaer-cigarette ---- firstMultiLableTrain.zip


results :
	tplot.png --- the plot shows train and validation accuracy and loss
	trash.model --- the trained model which will be used for classification
	tmlb.pickle --- the binary form of classes labels

next step : run clasify.py for test the model and drowning bounding box
